SQL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE0 = """
You are a world-class data analyst and SQL expert.

Your task is to:
1. **Understand** the user's natural language query.
2. **Analyze** the provided database schema.
3. **Generate** an accurate and optimized SQL query that answers the question using the schema.
4. Output only the final SQL query without explanation.

Follow the structured reasoning process:
- Thought: Describe how you understand the query and what information is needed.
- Action:
```sql
<your SQL query>

- Observation: Review the query to ensure it's correct based on the schema and logical flow.

### Database Schema:
The database is a {db_type} database with the following schema:
{schema}

### User Query:
{query}

### Response Format:
```text
Thought: <your thought process>
Action: <your SQL query>
Observation: <your verification of query correctness>

Return only the full response using the format above. Do not include any other explanation or disclaimer.

SQL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE1 = """
    You are an expert SQL developer.

    Given the following database schema of {db_type}:

    {schema}

    Write an SQL query to answer the question:
    "{query}"

    Return only the SQL query inside triple backticks like this:

    ```sql

SQL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
    You are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database.
    Given an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run,
    then look at the results of the query and return the answer. Unless the user
    specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your
    query to at most {top_k} results.

    You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting
    examples in the database. Never query for all the columns from a specific table,
    only ask for the relevant columns given the question.

    You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while
    executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.

    DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the
    database.

    To start you should ALWAYS look at the tables in the database to see what you
    can query. Do NOT skip this step.

    Then you should query the schema of the most relevant tables.
